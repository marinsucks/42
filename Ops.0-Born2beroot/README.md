# Born2beRoot Project

## Overview

I recently completed the Born2beRoot project, a system administration exercise that delves into setting up a secure server environment using virtualization technology. The project revolves around configuring a server following strict guidelines, emphasizing security protocols, and ensuring the proper implementation of various tools and policies.

## Skills Acquired

### System Administration

- **Virtualization Mastery**: Successfully set up a virtual machine using VirtualBox or UTM, adhering to project specifications.
- **Operating System Configuration**: Installed and configured Debian, focusing on strict rules such as minimal service installation and security measures like SSH configurations, firewalls, and user/group management.
- **Partitioning and Encryption**: Created encrypted partitions using LVM, meeting specific partitioning requirements.
- **Understanding Security Tools**: Gained knowledge about SELinux, AppArmor, package managers and their configurations for respective operating systems.

### Security Implementation

- **SSH Hardening**: Configured SSH to run on a specific port (4242) and restricted root access for enhanced security.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Implemented UFW, allowing only essential ports to enhance network security.
- **Password Policy Enforcement**: Implemented stringent password policies, including expiration, complexity requirements, and warnings.

### User and Group Management

- **User Setup and Permissions**: Created additional users, assigned them to appropriate groups (user42 and sudo groups), and managed their access rights.
- **Sudo Configuration**: Installed and configured sudo with strict rules for user privilege management.

## Business Relevance

The Born2beRoot project showcases my proficiency in system administration and security implementation, essential skills for any company relying on secure server setups and robust infrastructure. By completing this project, I've demonstrated the ability to:

- **Enhance Security**: Implement strict security protocols to safeguard sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Ensure Compliance**: Adhere to best practices and strict guidelines for system configuration and user management.
- **Troubleshoot and Maintain**: Acquire the skills to maintain, troubleshoot, and optimize server environments for reliability and efficiency.

This project reflects my commitment to learning and implementing industry-standard practices in system administration, offering a valuable asset to companies seeking skilled professionals in securing and managing their infrastructure. Cheers!
