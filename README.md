# My 42 Journey

Hey there! I'm Marin. I just finished the 42 Piscine, and I'm super excited to kick off my 42 cursus. This repo is here to share my projects and discoveries during my time at 42.

## About Me

I'm a student learning to code, diving into the world of 42 to learn and to eventually end up a full stack dev.  
Apart from work, I love creating awful melodies on the bass and getting my butt kicked by black belts in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu!

## My Projects

 - Basic C functions:
	- [**Piscine**](./0-piscine/) - Gotta start somewhere! I learned the basics in C.
	- [**libft**](./1-libft/) - I built my own basic C library.
	- [**ft_printf**](./2.0-ft_printf/) - I created my own implementation of printf.
	- [**get_next_line**](./2.1-get_next_line/) - Unlocked the magic of reading files line by line!

- [**Born2beRoot**](./2.2-Born2beroot/): I discovered system admininistration by setting up a secure server environment following strict guidelines.

- [**push_swap**](./3.0-push_swap/): An introduction to sorting algorithms through restricted operations.

- [**so_long**](./3.1-so_long/): Ever played pokemon? I designed and coded my own minigame using 42's [minilibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), an X11-based library.

- [**pipex**](./3.2-pipex/): A program reproducing the pipe `|` behavior. ~~Such a pain in th~~ Such a thrilling project!

- [**Philosophers**](./4.0-Philosophers/): In progress! Eat, sleep, think, repeat7 (don't lose the thread!)
