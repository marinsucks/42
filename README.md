# My 42 Journey

Hey there! I'm Marin, a student at [42 Paris](https://42.fr) since Nov 2023. This repo is here to share all of my projects made at 42. 

## C++ Projects

- 🆙 [**CPP Modules**](./CPP.0-modules/) - 🚧 In progress! 🚧 Ten modules to learn Object-Oriented Programming through C++.

## C Projects

- 🎮 [**cub3D**](https://github.com/42mates/cub3D) - A group project with [@ku-alexej](https://github.com/ku-alexej) where we created a 3D game using raycasting techniques, inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D.

- 🐚 [**Minishell**](https://github.com/42mates/minishell/) - A group project with [@ku-alexej](https://github.com/ku-alexej) where we reproduced our own basic reproduction of `bash`.

- 🍽️ [**Philosophers**](./C.8-Philosophers/) - I managed threads routine: _take a fork_, _eat_, _sleep_, _think_, _die_ - with mutexes, of course !

- 🚰 [**pipex**](./C.6-pipex/) - A program reproducing the pipe '`|`' behavior.

- ♻️ [**push_swap**](./C.5-push_swap/) - I implemented a sorting algorithm following restricted operations.

- 🕹️ [**so_long**](./C.4-so_long/) - Ever played Pokemon HeartGold? I designed and coded my own desktop minigame using 42's minilibx, a X11-based library.  

- 🐣 Basic C functions:
	- [**Piscine**](./C.0-piscine/) - Gotta start somewhere! I learned the basics of C and Shell.
	- [**libft**](./C.1-libft/) - I built my own basic C library.
	- [**ft_printf**](./C.2-printf/) - I created my own implementation of printf.
	- [**get_next_line**](./C.3-get_next_line/) - Unlocked the magic of reading files line by line!

## IT Projects

- 🐳 [**Docker**](./IT.1-Docker/) - 🚧 In progress! 🚧 I 'm containerizing applications and services with `docker-compose`.

- 🌱 [**Born2beroot**](./IT.0-Born2beroot/) - I set up a secure Linux server environment following strict guidelines.

- 🛜 [**NetPractice**](./IT.0-Born2beroot/) - I learnt how to connect small-scale networks using IPs and masks.
