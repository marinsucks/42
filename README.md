# My 42 Journey

Hey there! I'm Marin, a student at [42 Paris](https://github.com/42Paris) since Nov 2023. This repo is here to share all of my projects made at 42. 

## C Projects
- 🐣 Basic C functions:
	- [**Piscine**](./C.0-piscine/) - Gotta start somewhere! I learned the basics of C and Shell.
	- [**libft**](./C.1-libft/) - I built my own basic C library.
	- [**ft_printf**](./C.2-printf/) - I created my own implementation of printf.
	- [**get_next_line**](./C.3-get_next_line/) - Unlocked the magic of reading files line by line!

- 🕹️ [**so_long**](./C.4-so_long/) - Ever played Pokemon HeartGold? I designed and coded my own desktop minigame using 42's [`minilibx`](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), a X11-based library.

- ♻️ [**push_swap**](./C.5-push_swap/) - I implemented a sorting algorithm following restricted operations.

- 🚰 [**pipex**](./C.6-pipex/) - I redirected files I/O with program reproducing the pipe '`|`' behavior.

- 🍽️ [**Philosophers**](./C.8-Philosophers/) - I handled threads routine: _take a fork_, _eat_, _sleep_, _think_, _die_ - with mutexes, of course !

- 📟 [**Minishell**](https://github.com/42mates/minishell/) - A group project in which [@ku-alexej](https://github.com/ku-alexej) and I reproduced our own basic reproduction of `bash`.
