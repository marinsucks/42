# My 42 Journey

Hey there! I just finished the 42 Piscine, and I'm super excited to kick off my 42 cursus. This repo is here to share my projects and discoveries during my time at 42.

## About Me

I'm Marin, a student learning to code, diving into the world of 42 to learn and to eventually end up a full stack dev.  
Apart from work, I love creating awful melodies on the bass and getting my butt kicked by black belts in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu!

## My Projects

- [**Piscine**](./0-piscine/): I got my hands dirty with basic C programming during the 42 Piscine.

- [**libft**](./1-libft/): I built my own basic C library.

- [**ft_printf**](./2.0-ft_printf/): Implemented printf, delving into the intricacies of output formatting and string manipulation in C, ensuring precise and accurate output functionality.

- [**get_next_line**](./2.1-get_next_line/): Unlocked the magic of reading files line by line! Mastered file I/O, memory handling, and error management to craft a function that spins through files, delivering lines on demand. Optimized buffer size for efficient file processing.

- [**Born2beRoot**](./2.2-Born2beroot/): A system administration project, consisting in setting up a secure server environment following strict guidelines and emphasizing security protocols and configurations.

- [**push_swap**](./3.0-push_swap/): Back to the classic sorting algorithms! I sorted stacks, grooved with diverse sorting algorithms, and mastered linked list manipulations. Stack sorting like you've never seen before!

- [**so_long**](./3.1-so_long/): Ever played pokemon? This project will bring you a few years back! I designed and coded my own basic 2d game using the minilibx, an X11-based library.

- [**pipex**](./3.2-pipex/): In progress! I'm reproducing the pipe `|` behavior.

## Goals

During my studies at 42, here's what I'm aiming for:

- Explore new languages and tech stacks.
- Collaborate with fellow students on interesting and useful projects.
- Help others and share my knowledge.
- Level up my coding skills.
