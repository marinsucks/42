# My 42 Journey

Hey there! I just finished the 42 Piscine, and I'm super excited to kick off my 42 cursus. This repo is here to share my projects and discoveries during my time at 42.

## About Me

I'm Marin, a student learning to code, diving into the world of 42 to learn and to eventually end up a full stack dev.

## My Projects

- **Piscine**: I got my hands dirty with basic C programming during the 42 Piscine.

- **libft**: In progress ! Building up my own C library.

## Goals

During my studies at 42, here's what I'm aiming for:

- Explore new languages and tech stacks.
- Collaborate with fellow students on cool projects.
- Help others and share my knowledge.
- Level up my coding skills.

Cheers ;)
