# Push_Swap Project

## Overview

Push_Swap revolves around creating a program named `push_swap` that efficiently sorts a stack using a limited set of instructions while minimizing the number of operations.

## Skills Acquired

- **Algorithmic Exploration**: Explored various sorting strategies to optimize stack sorting and implemented [ayogun](https://github.com/ayogun)'s [Turk Algorithm](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97).
- **Linked List Manipulation**: Gained proficiency in manipulating linked lists, a crucial skill for stack-based algorithms.

## Project Details

### The `push_swap` Program

In progress ! 

### The `checker` Program (bonus)

The checker program takes a list of integers as an argument, reads instructions from the standard input, and executes these instructions on the provided stack.  
If, after execution, the initial stack is sorted and the secondary stack is empty, the program displays "OK"; otherwise, it displays "KO". In case of an error, it prints "Error".

## Business Relevance

This project underscores my ability to explore and implement diverse sorting algorithms, demonstrating adaptability in problem-solving. By mastering the latter, I've acquired valuable skills in optimizing sorting processes and efficiently manipulating linked lists.
