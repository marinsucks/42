	How does this apply to graphics and MiniLibX?
	When we're dealing with colors in graphics, we often represent them using 
	multiple bytes. For example, ARGB format uses 4 bytes to represent a color: 
	one byte each for the Alpha, Red, Green, and Blue components.
	If your system is Big-Endian, the ARGB value 0x12345678 would mean the alpha value
	is 0x12, the red value is 0x34, the green value is 0x56, and the blue value is 0x78.
		DO WE CARE? NO. ðŸ‘€
	Direct Memory Manipulation: While the endian value becomes critical when doing 
	direct memory manipulation byte-by-byte. 
	The manipulation is done using (unsigned int *) for the entire color value, namely the pixel. 
	This approach abstracts away the need for us to consider individual byte order for each color channel, thank god.
